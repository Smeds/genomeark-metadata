    description: >
      This "individual" represents the rat strain SHRSP/BbbUtx maintained at
      UTHealth by Dr. Peter Doris. Multiple individuals are grouped together
      because the strain is fully inbred and the genome is pseudohaploid.
      Collections from various inviduals have occurred at multiple
      timepoints, but they are generally being treated as coming from the
      same source (similar to having a cell line) for the purpose of genome
      assembly. A cell line was avoided so that somatic recombination could
      be studied. For the purpose of this Tree of Life ID (ToLID), all
      samples are from specimens at the same location and in the same
      conditions. A reference genome assembly has already been generated using
      PacBio HiFi and CLR (with other supporting data, e.g. Hi-C). The same
      strain is being used for a T2T assembly effort.

      description: >
        Multiple samples were collected throughout 2022-2023 from multiple male
        specimens. Intrabdominal testes are used to determine sex from these
        late gestational fetuses. These samples were used for DNA sequencing
        for the rat T2T project.
